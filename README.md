# Data-Analysis-Project-Using-PowerBI
Neo-Bank User Engagement Analysis

This project aimed to analyze user engagement data to identify factors influencing churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention.

Methodology:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Used SQL queries to extract and clean user data from a simulated Neo-Bank database.

Machine Learning: Built a churn prediction model using Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) to identify users at risk of churn.

Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to user engagement and churn.

Outcomes:

Gained insights into user behavior and identified key factors influencing churn.
Created visually compelling dashboards to communicate findings and support data-driven decision making.
